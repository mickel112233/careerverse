  "learningContent": "<h3>Harnessing Canva Elements</h3><p>The 'Elements' tab is a treasure trove of graphics, shapes, lines, photos, videos, and more. Mastering this section is fundamental to creating custom designs.</p><h4>Shapes and Lines</h4><p>Under 'Elements', you'll find a category for 'Lines & Shapes'. You can add basic shapes like squares, circles, and triangles. Once on the canvas, you can resize them, change their color, and add a border (with adjustable weight and style). Lines are versatile; you can change their thickness (line weight), style (dashed, dotted), and add arrowheads or other endpoints from the top bar.</p><h4>Graphics and Stickers</h4><p>This is where Canva truly shines. You can search for millions of icons, illustrations, and animated stickers. Use the search bar within the 'Elements' tab to find what you need (e.g., 'computer' or 'waving hand'). Many graphics allow you to change their colors for better brand alignment.</p><h4>Frames and Grids</h4><p>Frames are shape-based placeholders for your photos. Drag a photo onto a frame, and it will automatically be cropped to that shape (e.g., a circle, a letter, or a torn paper effect). Grids are layout placeholders that help you quickly create photo collages by dividing your page into sections.</p><h4>Searching and Filtering</h4><p>When searching for elements, use the filter icon to narrow your results. You can filter by color, orientation (vertical, horizontal), and animation type (static or animated). You can also filter to see only free elements or those available with Canva Pro.</p>",
