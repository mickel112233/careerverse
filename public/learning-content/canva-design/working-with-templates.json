  "learningContent": "<h3>Leveraging Templates in Canva</h3><p>Canva's templates are one of its most powerful features, providing a professional starting point for any design. This lesson covers how to find, use, and customize them.</p><h4>Finding the Right Template</h4><p>You can find templates in two main ways: by using the search bar on the homepage (e.g., 'birthday card') or by browsing the 'Templates' tab in the editor's side panel. The editor's template tab will show suggestions relevant to the dimensions of your current design.</p><h4>Applying and Customizing a Template</h4><p>Simply clicking on a template will apply it to your current page on the canvas. Once applied, every element is customizable:</p><ul><li><strong>Text:</strong> Click on any text box to edit the content, font, size, color, and spacing using the top bar tools.</li><li><strong>Images:</strong> You can replace template images by dragging your own photo from the 'Uploads' or 'Photos' tab directly on top of the existing image. Canva will automatically crop and fit it into the frame.</li><li><strong>Colors:</strong> Many templates have a pre-defined color palette. You can change any element's color individually, or use the 'Styles' tab to apply a new color palette to the entire design at once.</li><li><strong>Elements:</strong> You can delete, move, resize, or replace any graphic element just like you would on a blank canvas.</li></ul><h4>Combining Templates</h4><p>You are not limited to a single template. You can apply a template to one page, then navigate to a new page and apply a different template. This is useful for creating multi-page documents like presentations or e-books.</p>",
