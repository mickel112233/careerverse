  "learningContent": "<h3>Welcome to Canva!</h3><p>Canva is a powerful and user-friendly graphic design platform that allows you to create a wide variety of visual content. In this first lesson, we'll get familiar with the main interface so you can navigate it with confidence.</p><h4>The Home Page</h4><p>When you first log in, you'll see the Canva home page. It's your central hub for everything. Hereâ€™s a quick breakdown:</p><ul><li><strong>Top Navigation Bar:</strong> This bar contains links to templates, features, and your account settings.</li><li><strong>'Create a design' Button:</strong> Located in the top-right corner, this is where you'll start most of your projects. You can choose from suggested dimensions (like 'Instagram Post') or set custom dimensions.</li><li><strong>Search Bar:</strong> Right in the middle of the page, this is the quickest way to find templates for anything you want to create, from presentations to logos.</li><li><strong>Your Projects:</strong> Below the search bar, you'll find a section displaying your recent designs for easy access.</li></ul><h4>The Canva Editor</h4><p>When you start a new design, you'll enter the Canva Editor. This is where the magic happens. The editor is divided into three main sections:</p><ol><li><strong>The Left-Side Panel:</strong> This is your toolkit. It contains tabs for 'Templates', 'Elements' (like icons, shapes, and photos), 'Uploads' (your own images), 'Text', and more.</li><li><strong>The Main Canvas:</strong> This is the large area in the center where you build your design. It's your creative playground.</li><li><strong>The Top Bar:</strong> This bar appears above the canvas and is context-sensitive. When you select an element (like text or an image), this bar will show you all the tools to customize it, such as font options, colors, effects, and positioning tools.</li></ol><p>Spend some time clicking around these three areas. Get a feel for where the tools are located. In the next lesson, we'll start using them to create a simple design.</p>",
