You can then drag it to position it and use the corner handles to resize it.</p><p><strong>Customizing:</strong> Select any element on your canvas to see its customization options in the top toolbar. You can change colors, fonts, transparency, position, and much more.</p><p><strong>Sharing and Downloading:</strong> When your design is ready, use the 'Share' button in the top right corner.
