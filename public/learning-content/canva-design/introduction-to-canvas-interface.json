  "learningContent": "<h3>Welcome to Canva!</h3><p>Canva is a powerful and user-friendly graphic design platform that allows you to create a wide variety of visual content. This first lesson will familiarize you with the main interface so you can navigate it with confidence.</p><h4>The Home Page</h4><p>When you first log in, you'll see the Canva home page. It's your central hub for starting new designs and accessing your previous work. Key areas include:</p><ul><li><strong>Top Navigation Bar:</strong> Access design types, templates, and learning resources.</li><li><strong>'Create a design' Button:</strong> Your starting point for any new project. It opens a dropdown of popular document types like Instagram posts, presentations, and logos.</li><li><strong>Your Projects:</strong> A gallery of all the designs you've created, saved automatically.</li></ul><h4>The Editor Interface</h4><p>Once you select a design type, you enter the Canva editor. This is where the magic happens. The editor is split into three main sections:</p><ul><li><strong>The Side Panel (Left):</strong> This is your toolkit. It contains tabs for Templates, Elements (like shapes, icons, and photos), Uploads, Text, and more.</li><li><strong>The Canvas (Center):</strong> This is your main design area. You'll add and arrange all your content here.</li><li><strong>The Top Bar (Top):</strong> This bar is contextual. It changes based on what you have selected on your canvas. For example, if you select text, it will show options for font, size, color, and formatting.</li></ul><p>Spend some time clicking around these areas to see what's available. The best way to learn is by exploring!</p>",
