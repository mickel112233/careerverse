  "learningContent": "<h3>Applying Color in Canva</h3><p>Color is one of the most impactful parts of a design. Canva provides excellent tools for managing colors and creating beautiful palettes.</p><h4>The Color Picker</h4><p>When you select an element, a color swatch appears in the top bar. Clicking it opens the color panel. Here you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Document Colors:</strong> See all colors currently used in your design.</li><li><strong>Photo Colors:</strong> Canva intelligently extracts a palette from the photos on your page.</li><li><strong>Default Palettes:</strong> A selection of pre-made palettes.</li><li><strong>Add a new color:</strong> Use the rainbow tile to open a detailed color picker with a hex code input and an eyedropper tool to sample colors directly from your design.</li></ul><h4>Using the Styles Tab</h4><p>The 'Styles' tab in the side panel is perfect for experimentation. You can browse through combinations of color palettes and font pairings. Clicking a color palette will apply it to your entire page. You can click it again to shuffle the colors among the elements, giving you different variations.</p><h4>Understanding Hex Codes</h4><p>A hex code is a six-character code (e.g., #FFFFFF for white) that represents a specific color. This is the most common way to ensure you are using the exact same color across different designs or platforms, which is crucial for branding.</p><h4>Brand Kit (Pro Feature)</h4><p>For consistent branding, Canva Pro's 'Brand Kit' allows you to save your brand's colors, fonts, and logos. This makes them easily accessible in any new design, ensuring brand consistency with one click.</p>",
