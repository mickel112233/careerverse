  "learningContent": "<h3>Mastering Text in Canva</h3><p>Typography is crucial for effective design. It's not just what you say, but how you say it. This lesson explores Canva's text tools.</p><h4>Adding and Editing Text</h4><p>You can add text by selecting the 'Text' tab in the side panel and clicking 'Add a heading', 'Add a subheading', or 'Add a little bit of body text'. Alternatively, just press the 'T' key on your keyboard to add a text box. Once added, you can edit its content, font, size, color, alignment, and spacing (letter and line) from the top bar.</p><h4>Font Pairing</h4><p>Choosing fonts that work well together is key. A common rule is to pair a serif font (with small lines attached to characters, e.g., Times New Roman) with a sans-serif font (without lines, e.g., Arial). Canva's 'Styles' tab and 'Text' tab often suggest proven font combinations.</p><h4>Text Effects</h4><p>Canva offers powerful text effects. Select a text box and click 'Effects' in the top bar. Here you can find options like:</p><ul><li><strong>Shadow:</strong> Adds a drop shadow with customizable offset, direction, and color.</li><li><strong>Lift:</strong> Adds a subtle, blurry shadow to make text pop.</li><li><strong>Hollow/Splice:</strong> Creates an outline effect.</li><li><strong>Curve:</strong> Bends your text into an arc, which you can adjust.</li></ul><h4>Creating a Text Hierarchy</h4><p>Good design uses a clear hierarchy to guide the reader's eye. Use different sizes, weights (bold, regular), and styles for headings, subheadings, and body text to create a structure that is easy to read and understand.</p>",
