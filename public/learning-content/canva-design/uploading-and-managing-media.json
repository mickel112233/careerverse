  "learningContent": "<h3>Managing Your Media in Canva</h3><p>While Canva offers millions of stock assets, the ability to upload and use your own media is essential for personalization and branding. This lesson focuses on the 'Uploads' tab.</p><h4>Uploading Files</h4><p>Navigate to the 'Uploads' tab in the side panel. You can click the 'Upload files' button to select files from your computer. Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop files directly from your desktop onto the Canva editor. Canva supports various file types, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Images:</strong> JPG, PNG, SVG, HEIC</li><li><strong>Videos:</strong> MP4, MOV, GIF</li><li><strong>Audio:</strong> MP3, M4A, WAV</li></ul><h4>Organizing Uploads with Folders (Pro Feature)</h4><p>As you upload more files, your 'Uploads' tab can become cluttered. Canva Pro users can create folders to organize their media. You can create folders for different projects, clients, or types of assets (e.g., 'Logos', 'Headshots'). This is a crucial feature for professional designers and teams.</p><h4>Editing Uploaded Images and Videos</h4><p>Once an image is on your canvas, you can select it and click 'Edit photo' in the top bar. This opens a panel with tools like:</p><ul><li><strong>Filters:</strong> Apply Instagram-style color filters.</li><li><strong>Adjust:</strong> Manually control brightness, contrast, saturation, and other properties.</li><li><strong>Effects:</strong> Access powerful AI tools like the 'Background Remover' (a popular Pro feature).</li></ul><p>For videos, you can trim their length, crop their dimensions, adjust their playback speed, and control their volume directly from the top bar.</p>",
