Here you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Search for templates:</strong> Use the search bar to find templates for anything from Instagram posts to business presentations.</li><li><strong>Start a design:</strong> Click 'Create a design' to start with a blank canvas or choose a specific dimension.</li><li><strong>Access your projects:</strong> All your past designs are saved and accessible from the homepage.</li></ul><h4>The Canva Editor</h4><p>The editor is where the magic happens. It's composed of three main areas:</p><ol><li><strong>The Left Panel:</strong> This is your toolbox. It contains tabs for Templates, Elements (like shapes, icons, photos, and videos), Uploads, Text, and more.</li><li><strong>The Top Bar:</strong> This bar is contextual. It changes based on what element you have selected on your canvas. For example, if you select text, you'll see options for font, size, color, and spacing.</li><li><strong>The Canvas:</strong> This is your design area in the center of the screen. You can add, arrange, and edit all your design elements here.</li></ol>",

Clicking one will apply that animation to all elements on the page.</li><li><strong>Animate Individual Elements:</strong> Select a specific element (like a text box or a graphic). Now when you click 'Animate', you'll see options to animate just that element. This gives you more control.</li></ol><h4>Animation Controls</h4><p>When you select an animation, you can often control its direction (e.g., pan in from left or right) and intensity. You can also specify if the animation should happen on 'Enter', 'Exit', or both.</p><p>When you add any animation, your design's download options will now include MP4 Video and GIF.</p>",

Select an image, click 'Edit Photo', and go to 'Shadows'. You can choose from different types like:</p><ul><li><strong>Glow:</strong> A soft shadow all around the object.</li><li><strong>Drop:</strong> A classic shadow offset to one side.</li><li><strong>Outline:</strong> A solid border around the object.</li></ul><p>Adjusting the size, blur intensity, and angle of these shadows can make elements feel like they are lifting off the page.</p><h4>Blur</h4><p>Blur can be used to create a sense of distance. By slightly blurring background elements, you mimic how our eyes perceive depth. In the 'Edit Photo' > 'Adjust' tab, you can find a 'Blur' or 'Sharpness' slider. Reducing the sharpness will create a blur effect. This technique helps to draw the viewer's focus to the sharp, in-focus elements in the foreground.</p>",
