Here you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Search for templates:</strong> Use the search bar to find templates for anything from Instagram posts to business presentations.</li><li><strong>Start a design:</strong> Click 'Create a design' to start with a blank canvas or choose a specific dimension.</li><li><strong>Access your projects:</strong> All your past designs are saved and accessible from the homepage.</li></ul><h4>The Canva Editor</h4><p>The editor is where the magic happens. It's composed of three main areas:</p><ol><li><strong>The Left Panel:</strong> This is your toolbox. It contains tabs for Templates, Elements (like shapes, icons, photos, and videos), Uploads, Text, and more.</li><li><strong>The Top Bar:</strong> This bar is contextual. It changes based on what element you have selected on your canvas. For example, if you select text, you'll see options for font, size, color, and spacing.</li><li><strong>The Canvas:</strong> This is your design area in the center of the screen. You can add, arrange, and edit all your design elements here.</li></ol>",
