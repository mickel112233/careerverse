After printing, large sheets are trimmed down to the final size. If your design has colors or images that go right to the edge, any slight shift during trimming could result in a thin white line on the final product. Bleed is the practice of extending your background color or image slightly beyond the final trim line. This extra area gets trimmed off, but it ensures that there are no unprinted edges.</p><h4>Bleed in Canva</h4><p>To see the bleed area, go to 'File' > 'View settings' and select 'Show print bleed'. This will add a dotted line around your canvas. You should extend any background elements all the way to this outer bleed line.

Use a bold, large font for your heading and a light, small font for your body. Use a dark background with light text. Contrast helps create a focal point and guide the reader's eye.</li><li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Repeat visual elements throughout your design. Use the same font style for all your headings, the same color for all your icons, the same shape for all your buttons. Repetition creates consistency and unity.</li><li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Nothing should be placed on the page arbitrarily. Every element should have a visual connection to another element. Use Canva's guides to align objects to the left, right, or center. Proper alignment creates a clean, organized look.</li><li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Group related items together. Place a photo caption close to the photo. Keep the address and phone number of a business close to each other on a flyer. Proximity helps organize information and reduces clutter.</li></ul>",

Use a high-quality photo, your brand colors, and clear text.</li><li><strong>An Instagram Story (Vertical):</strong> A more engaging, perhaps animated version. Use animations on the text and maybe a simple video background.</li><li><strong>A Facebook Banner (Horizontal):</strong> To update your Facebook page, showcasing the new product.</li></ol><h4>The Goal</h4><p>The challenge is to maintain brand consistency across all three designs, even though they have different dimensions. Use the same fonts, color palette, and logo placement strategy. You can use the 'Magic Resize' tool to help you get started. This project will test your skills in layout, typography, branding, and repurposing content.</p>",
