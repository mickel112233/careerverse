Key areas include:</p><ul><li><b>Top Bar:</b> Contains file options (save, resize), undo/redo buttons, and the share button.</li><li><b>Left Panel:</b> This is your creative toolkit. It has tabs for Templates, Elements, Text, Brand, Uploads, and more.</li><li><b>Canvas:</b> The central area where your design comes to life.</li><li><b>Contextual Toolbar:</b> Appears at the top when you select an element (like text or a shape), giving you options to change its color, font, position, etc.</li></ul>",

Canva will suggest templates and sizes.</li><li><b>From the Editor:</b> Inside the editor, the 'Templates' tab on the left panel allows you to search and apply different templates to your current design. You can filter by style, theme, and color.</li></ul><h4>Customizing a Template</h4><p>Once you've chosen a template, every part of it is customizable. You can:</p><ul><li><b>Change Text:</b> Click on any text box to edit the content, font, size, and color.</li><li><b>Replace Images:</b> Drag and drop your own uploaded images or a new stock photo directly onto an existing image to replace it.</li><li><b>Modify Colors:</b> Select any element (like a background or shape) and use the color swatch in the top toolbar to change its color. Canva will often suggest 'Document Colors' to help you maintain consistency.</li><li><b>Move and Resize:</b> Click and drag elements to reposition them. Use the corner handles to resize.</li></ul>",
