This first lesson introduces you to the two main areas you'll be using: the Canva dashboard and the editor.</p><h4>The Canva Dashboard</h4><p>Upon logging in, the dashboard serves as your creative hub. From here, you can:</p><ul><li><strong>Discover Templates:</strong> Utilize the prominent search bar to find thousands of templates for any conceivable project, from social media posts to professional presentations.</li><li><strong>Initiate a New Design:</strong> Click the 'Create a design' button to choose from specific dimensions (like an Instagram Story) or define custom dimensions for a blank canvas.</li><li><strong>Manage Your Projects:</strong> All your past designs are automatically saved and neatly organized under 'Your Projects' for easy access and editing.</li></ul><h4>The Canva Editor</h4><p>The editor is your creative playground. It's primarily composed of three essential sections:</p><ol><li><strong>The Side Panel (Toolbox):</strong> Located on the left, this panel is your main toolbox. It houses tabs for Templates, a vast library of 'Elements' (shapes, icons, photos, videos), your personal 'Uploads', a versatile 'Text' tool, and many more powerful features.</li><li><strong>The Top Bar (Context Menu):</strong> This bar is dynamic and adapts to the element you have selected on your canvas. For instance, selecting a text box will reveal options for fonts, sizing, colors, spacing, and effects.</li><li><strong>The Canvas:</strong> The central area of your screen is the canvas. Here, you will add, arrange, edit, and bring all your design elements together to form your final masterpiece.</li></ol>",

Canva will automatically crop and fit them. You can also swap them with photos from Canva's library in the 'Elements' tab.</li><li><strong>Colors:</strong> Select any element (like a background or shape) and use the color swatch in the top bar to change its color.
