  "learningContent": "<h3>Controlling the Structure of AI Output</h3><p>One of the most practical skills in prompt engineering is telling ChatGPT exactly *how* you want your information formatted. By specifying the output format, you turn unstructured text into organized, usable data. The most common formats are lists, tables, and JSON.</p><h4>1. Requesting Lists</h4><p>This is the simplest format. Use keywords like 'list,' 'bullet points,' or 'numbered list' to get a clean, easy-to-read output.</p><p><strong>Prompt:</strong> 'List the top 5 most populated countries in the world in descending order.'</p><h4>2. Requesting Tables</h4><p>Tables are perfect for comparing data. To get a table, you need to be explicit about the columns and the format. Markdown is a simple and effective way to request tables.</p><p><strong>Prompt:</strong> 'Generate a markdown table comparing the pros and cons of Python and JavaScript for web development. The columns should be: Feature, Python, and JavaScript.'</p><h4>3. Requesting JSON</h4><p>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a standard format for data exchange, crucial for any programming or automation task. Requesting JSON output allows you to directly use the AI's response in your applications. Be very clear about the desired structure, including keys and value types (string, number, array, etc.).</p><p><strong>Prompt:</strong> 'Generate a JSON object for a user profile. It must include the following keys: 'userId' (number), 'username' (string), 'email' (string), and 'isActive' (boolean). Set 'isActive' to true.'</p><h4>Why is This Important?</h4><p>Requesting structured data is the bridge between conversational AI and practical application. Instead of manually copying and pasting information, you get data that is immediately ready for use in a spreadsheet, a database, a website, or a piece of code. This skill transforms ChatGPT from a simple chatbot into a powerful data generation tool.</p>",
