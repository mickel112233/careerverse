  "learningContent": "<h3>The Two Pillars: Clarity and Context</h3><p>To master ChatGPT, you must master the art of prompting. The two most important pillars of a great prompt are <strong>Clarity</strong> and <strong>Context</strong>. Without them, you're leaving the AI's output to chance.</p><h4>Clarity: Be Explicit</h4><p>Clarity means giving direct, unambiguous instructions. The AI doesn't know what you're thinking, so you have to tell it exactly what you want. Avoid vague language.</p><ul><li><strong>Vague:</strong> 'Write about dogs.'</li><li><strong>Clear:</strong> 'Write a 100-word blog post introduction about why Golden Retrievers make excellent family pets. Use a friendly and informative tone.'</li></ul><p>A clear prompt specifies the <strong>format</strong> (blog post intro), <strong>topic</strong> (Golden Retrievers as family pets), <strong>length</strong> (100 words), and <strong>tone</strong> (friendly and informative).</p><h4>Context: Provide the Necessary Background</h4><p>Context is the background information the AI needs to fulfill your request accurately. If you're asking it to write an email, tell it who the email is for, who it's from, and the key points to include.</p><ul><li><strong>Without Context:</strong> 'Write an email to my boss.'</li><li><strong>With Context:</strong> 'Write a professional email to my boss, Sarah, from me, Alex. I need to request a deadline extension for the Q3 report from this Friday to next Tuesday. Mention that this is due to unexpected delays in receiving the data from the sales team.'</li></ul><p>By providing context, you give the AI the raw materials it needs to craft the perfect response. Always assume the AI knows nothing about your specific situation.</p>",

        "correctAnswer": "It doesn't give the AI enough direction on genre, characters, or plot.",
        "explanation": "Vague prompts leave too much to interpretation, resulting in generic or irrelevant outputs."
