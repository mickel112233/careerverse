  "learningContent": "<h3>Mastering the Art of Condensing Information</h3><p>Summarization is one of ChatGPT's most practical and powerful capabilities. Whether you're dealing with a long article, a business report, or a complex email thread, knowing how to prompt for a good summary can save you a significant amount of time. The key is to be specific about the length and focus of the summary you need.</p><h4>Basic Summarization</h4><p>The simplest way to summarize is to paste the text and ask the AI to summarize it. For better results, provide the text within your prompt.</p><p><strong>Prompt:</strong> 'Summarize the following article in three sentences: [paste article text here]'</p><h4>Advanced Summarization Techniques</h4><ol><li><strong>Specify the Audience:</strong> Tailor the complexity of the summary. 'Summarize this scientific paper for a high school student.' vs. 'Summarize this paper for a PhD researcher in the same field.'</li><li><strong>Control the Length:</strong> Be explicit about how long you want the summary to be. You can use word count ('in 50 words'), sentence count ('in 3 sentences'), or format ('in a single paragraph').</li><li><strong>Focus on Key Information:</strong> Guide the AI on what to prioritize. 'Summarize the attached meeting notes, focusing specifically on the action items assigned to the marketing team.'</li><li><strong>Change the Format:</strong> A summary doesn't have to be a paragraph. 'Summarize the key points of this article as a bulleted list.' or 'Summarize this business plan's financial projections in a markdown table.'</li></ol><h4>Summarizing Very Long Documents</h4><p>ChatGPT has a context window, which is the maximum amount of text it can remember at one time. If a document is too long to fit, you can't paste it all at once. The best approach is to summarize it in chunks.</p><p><strong>The Chunking Method:</strong></p><ol><li><strong>Step 1:</strong> Copy and paste the first part of the document (e.g., the first 1000 words). Prompt: 'Summarize the key points of the following text: [paste text chunk 1]'</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong> Copy the next chunk. Prompt: 'Here is the next part of the text. Combine the key points from this with the previous summary: [paste text chunk 2]'</li><li><strong>Step 3:</strong> Repeat this process for all chunks.</li><li><strong>Step 4 (Final):</strong> Once you've processed all chunks, ask for a final, cohesive summary. Prompt: 'Now, create a final, unified summary of all the key points we've discussed.'</li></ol><p>This method allows you to distill massive documents down to their essential points effectively.</p>",

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "'Summarize this transcript, focusing only on the final decisions and action items.'",
        "explanation": "Specifying the focus (decisions and action items) tells the AI to ignore irrelevant discussion and extract only what you need."
