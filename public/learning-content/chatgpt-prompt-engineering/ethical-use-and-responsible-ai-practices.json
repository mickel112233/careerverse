  "learningContent": "<h3>Using AI with Integrity and Responsibility</h3><p>As AI becomes more integrated into our professional and personal lives, using it ethically and responsibly is not just good practiceâ€”it's a necessity. Responsible AI usage involves understanding privacy, avoiding misuse, and maintaining academic and professional integrity.</p><h4>1. Privacy and Confidentiality</h4><p>This is the golden rule: <strong>Never input sensitive, personal, or proprietary information into public AI models like ChatGPT.</strong> This includes, but is not limited to:</p><ul><li>Personal identifiable information (PII) like names, addresses, phone numbers.</li><li>Confidential company data, trade secrets, or internal documents.</li><li>Private conversations or emails.</li><li>Unpublished research or creative work.</li></ul><p>Treat any information you give to a public AI as potentially public. For sensitive data, companies should use private, enterprise-grade AI solutions.</p><h4>2. Avoiding Malicious Use</h4><p>AI can be used for harmful purposes. As a responsible user, you must commit to not using these tools for:</p><ul><li>Creating misinformation or 'fake news.'</li><li>Generating spam or phishing emails.</li><li>Writing malicious code.</li><li>Harassing or impersonating others.</li></ul><h4>3. Academic and Professional Integrity</h4><p>Using AI in school or at work requires transparency and honesty. Simply copying and pasting an AI's output and claiming it as your own is plagiarism.</p><p><strong>Acceptable Use (usually):</strong></p><ul><li>Brainstorming ideas and creating outlines.</li><li>Summarizing your own research notes.</li><li>Rephrasing your own sentences for clarity or a different tone.</li><li>Checking your own work for grammatical errors.</li><li>Generating code snippets that you understand and integrate into your larger project.</li></ul><p><strong>Unacceptable Use (Plagiarism):</strong></p><ul><li>Generating an entire essay or report and submitting it as your own.</li><li>Answering test or assignment questions without permission.</li><li>Presenting AI-generated code as your own without understanding how it works.</li></ul><p><strong>The Guideline:</strong> Always check your institution's or company's specific AI usage policy. When in doubt, be transparent about how you used AI to assist your work. Use it as a tool to *augment* your intelligence, not to *replace* your effort.</p>",
