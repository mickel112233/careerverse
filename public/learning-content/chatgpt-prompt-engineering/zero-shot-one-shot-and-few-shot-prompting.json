  "learningContent": "<h3>Guiding AI with Examples</h3><p>In prompt engineering, 'shot' refers to the number of examples you provide to the AI within your prompt to guide its response. Understanding the difference between Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Few-Shot prompting is key to controlling the output style and structure.</p><h4>Zero-Shot Prompting</h4><p>This is the most common type of prompt. You ask the AI to perform a task without giving it any prior examples of how to do it. You are relying on the AI's existing training to understand the request.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong> 'Classify the following movie review as positive or negative: \"This movie was a masterpiece, I loved every minute of it!\"'</p><p>Zero-shot works well for general tasks, but for specific or nuanced outputs, you need to provide examples.</p><h4>One-Shot Prompting</h4><p>In one-shot prompting, you provide a single example of the input and the desired output. This gives the AI a clear template to follow.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong><br><code>Review: \"This was the worst coffee I've ever had.\"<br>Sentiment: Negative<br><br>Review: \"The service was amazing and the food was delicious!\"<br>Sentiment:</code><br>The AI will see the example and know to output 'Positive'.</p><h4>Few-Shot Prompting</h4><p>Few-shot prompting takes this a step further by providing multiple examples (usually 2 to 5). This is extremely powerful for teaching the AI a very specific format or style that might not be common in its training data.</p><p><strong>Example:</strong><br><code>Input: 'Apple'<br>Output: 'Fruit'<br><br>Input: 'Carrot'<br>Output: 'Vegetable'<br><br>Input: 'Spinach'<br>Output:</code><br>By providing two examples, you strongly guide the AI to classify 'Spinach' as 'Vegetable'.</p><h4>When to Use Each?</h4><ul><li><strong>Zero-Shot:</strong> Use for simple, common tasks like summarization, general questions, or simple classification.</li><li><strong>One-Shot:</strong> Use when you need a specific format that needs a single, clear example (e.g., Question -> Answer).</li><li><strong>Few-Shot:</strong> Use for complex or custom tasks where the AI needs to learn a specific pattern, style, or data structure. This is the most reliable way to get consistent, structured output.</li></ul>",
