          "content": "<h3>Welcome to the World of Prompting!</h3><p>Prompt engineering is the art of communicating with AI models like ChatGPT. Think of it as learning the AI's language. A good prompt is clear, specific, and provides enough context for the AI to give you the exact response you want. It's the difference between asking 'Tell me about dogs' and 'Explain the typical behavior of a Golden Retriever puppy, focusing on its training needs, in a friendly and encouraging tone for a new owner.' The second prompt will always give a better result.</p><h4>Core Concepts:</h4><ul><li><strong>Clarity:</strong> Use simple, direct language. Avoid jargon unless necessary.</li><li><strong>Context:</strong> Provide background information. The more the AI knows, the better it can help.</li><li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Tell the AI what *not* to do, or specify the format (e.g., 'in a bulleted list', 'as a JSON object').</li><li><strong>Persona:</strong> Ask the AI to act as an expert (e.g., 'You are a master copywriter...').</li></ul>",

While not all are needed every time, understanding them helps you build powerful instructions.</p><h4>Key Components (CRISP Framework):</h4><ul><li><strong>(C)ontext & Role:</strong> Set the stage. Who is the AI? Who are you? What's the scenario? <em>Example: 'You are a travel agent...'</em></li><li><strong>(R)equest & Task:</strong> What do you want the AI to do? Be explicit. <em>Example: '...create a 7-day itinerary for a trip to Tokyo.'</em></li><li><strong>(I)nstructions & Constraints:</strong> Provide specific rules. <em>Example: 'The budget is $2000. Focus on cultural sites and avoid tourist traps. The output should be a markdown table.'</em></li><li><strong>(S)pecificity & Source:</strong> Add details. If you have data, include it. <em>Example: 'Include at least one day trip to Hakone. Use information only up to 2023.'</em></li><li><strong>(P)ersona & Tone:</strong> Define the writing style. <em>Example: 'Write in an enthusiastic and friendly tone.'</em></li></ul>",

This is where 'shots' come in.</p><h4>Zero-Shot Prompting:</h4><p>This is the most common type. You ask the AI to do something without giving it any prior examples. <em>Example: 'Classify this email as spam or not spam: ...'</em></p><h4>Few-Shot Prompting:</h4><p>Here, you provide a few examples of input and desired output before making your actual request. This helps the AI understand the pattern and format you want.</p><p><em>Example:</em></p><p><em>Input: 'I love this movie!' -> Output: Positive<br>Input: 'The worst service ever.' -> Output: Negative<br>Input: 'It was okay, not great.' -> Output: Neutral<br>Input: 'This is absolutely fantastic!' -> Output: ???</em></p><p>The AI will correctly identify the last one as 'Positive' because you've shown it the pattern.</p>",
