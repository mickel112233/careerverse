Itâ€™s like being a director for an AI actor; your instructions determine the quality of the performance.</p><h4>Key Concepts:</h4><ul><li><strong>Prompt:</strong> The text input you give to the AI.</li><li><strong>Output/Completion:</strong> The text the AI generates in response.</li><li><strong>Context Window:</strong> The amount of text the model can remember and consider from the current conversation.</li></ul><p>Good prompting is crucial because it bridges the gap between human intent and the AI's vast but literal understanding of language.</p>",

This sets the tone and style.</li><li><strong>Task:</strong> Clearly defining what you want the AI to do (e.g., 'Write a blog post', 'Summarize this text').</li><li><strong>Context:</strong> Providing relevant background information the AI needs to complete the task.</li><li><strong>Format:</strong> Specifying the desired output structure (e.g., 'in a JSON format', 'as a bulleted list', 'in a table').</li><li><strong>Constraints:</strong> Setting limitations (e.g., 'in under 100 words', 'using simple language').</li></ul>",

You ask the AI to perform a task without giving it any prior examples. (e.g., 'Translate 'hello' to French.')</li><li><strong>One-Shot Prompting:</strong> You provide a single example of the task before making your request. (e.g., 'English: apple -> French: pomme. English: hello -> French:')</li><li><strong>Few-Shot Prompting:</strong> You provide several examples.
