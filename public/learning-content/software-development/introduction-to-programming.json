  "learningContent": "<h3>What is Programming?</h3><p>Programming is the process of creating a set of instructions that tell a computer how to perform a task. These instructions are written in a specific language that the computer can understand, known as a programming language.</p><h4>Core Concepts</h4><ul><li><strong>Variables:</strong> Containers for storing data values. In programming, you might have a variable named `score` to hold a player's score.</li><li><strong>Data Types:</strong> The type of data a variable can hold, like numbers (integers, floats), text (strings), or true/false values (booleans).</li><li><strong>Control Structures:</strong> These direct the flow of a program. This includes `if` statements (to make decisions) and `loops` (to repeat actions).</li><li><strong>Functions:</strong> A block of code designed to perform a particular task. Functions help organize code and make it reusable.</li></ul><h3>Why Learn Programming?</h3><p>Programming is a fundamental skill in the digital age. It powers websites, mobile apps, video games, and even complex AI systems. Learning to program develops problem-solving skills, logical thinking, and creativity.</p>",

      {
        "question": "What is the primary purpose of a variable in programming?",
        "options": [
          "To store data values that can be used and changed",
          "To end the program",
          "To display text on the screen",
          "To create a loop"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "To store data values that can be used and changed",
        "explanation": "Variables act as named containers for storing information that your program needs to work with."
      },
      {
        "question": "Which of these is NOT a common data type?",
        "options": [
          "String",
          "Integer",
          "Boolean",
          "Function"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Function",
        "explanation": "While functions are a core part of programming, they are a block of code, not a fundamental data type like String, Integer, or Boolean."
      },
      {
        "question": "What control structure is used to make decisions in code?",
        "options": [
          "For Loop",
          "If Statement",
          "Variable Declaration",
          "Function Call"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "If Statement",
        "explanation": "If statements allow a program to execute different code blocks based on whether a certain condition is true or false."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the main benefit of using functions?",
        "options": [
          "They make the code run faster",
          "They allow you to reuse code without rewriting it",
          "They are the only way to store data",
          "They make the code longer"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "They allow you to reuse code without rewriting it",
        "explanation": "Functions encapsulate logic into reusable blocks, making code more organized, efficient, and easier to maintain."

        "correctAnswer": "String",
        "explanation": "Strings are used to represent text, which is perfect for storing names."

          "A Loop",
          "A Comment"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "A Loop",
        "explanation": "Loops are designed specifically for repeating a block of code multiple times, either a set number of times or until a condition is met."
      },
      {
        "question": "A value that can be either true or false is called a...?",
