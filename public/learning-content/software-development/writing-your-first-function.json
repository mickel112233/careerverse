This is how real programs are built: by combining simple building blocks into more complex, logical structures.</p><h4>The Goal</h4><p>We want to write a function named <code>canPlayerVote</code>. This function will take one piece of information, a person's age, and will decide if they are old enough to vote. In this case, we'll assume the voting age is 18. The function should return a boolean value: <code>true</code> if they can vote, and <code>false</code> if they cannot.</p><h4>Step 1: Define the Function Signature</h4><p>First, we need to define our function. It will be called <code>canPlayerVote</code> and it will accept one input, which we'll call the parameter <code>age</code>.</p><pre><code>function canPlayerVote(age) {\n  // Logic will go here\n}</code></pre><h4>Step 2: Implement the Logic with an <code>if-else</code> Statement</h4><p>Inside the function, we need to check if the provided <code>age</code> is greater than or equal to 18. This is a perfect use case for an <code>if-else</code> statement. We'll use a comparison operator (<code>>=</code>) for the condition.</p><ul><li>If <code>age >= 18</code> is true, we should return <code>true</code>.</li><li>If it's false, we should return <code>false</code>.</li></ul><pre><code>function canPlayerVote(age) {\n  if (age >= 18) {\n    return true;\n  } else {\n    return false;\n  }\n}</code></pre><h4>Step 3: Call the Function and Use its Return Value</h4><p>Now that our function is defined, we can call it with different arguments (ages) and see the results. We'll store the returned boolean value in a variable.</p><pre><code>let personOneAge = 25;\nlet personTwoAge = 16;\n\nlet personOneCanVote = canPlayerVote(personOneAge); // Will be true\nlet personTwoCanVote = canPlayerVote(personTwoAge); // Will be false\n\nconsole.log(\"Is person one able to vote? \" + personOneCanVote);\n// Output: Is person one able to vote? true\n\nconsole.log(\"Is person two able to vote? \" + personTwoCanVote);\n// Output: Is person two able to vote? false</code></pre><h4>A More Concise Version</h4><p>Because the comparison <code>age >= 18</code> *already* evaluates to a boolean (<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>), we can simplify our function to a single line. This is a common pattern you'll see in professional code.</p><pre><code>function canPlayerVote(age) {\n  return age >= 18;\n}</code></pre><p>This version does the exact same thing as the <code>if-else</code> version but is much shorter. Congratulations! You've just written and analyzed a complete, practical function from scratch.</p>",

          "An if-else statement",

        ],

      {
        "question": "Why can the function `function canPlayerVote(age) { if (age >= 18) { return true; } else { return false; } }` be simplified?",
        "options": [
          "Because functions should not have `if-else` statements.",
          "Because the comparison `age >= 18` itself already evaluates to a boolean.",
          "Because `return` is not needed.",
          "Because loops are more efficient."
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Because the comparison `age >= 18` itself already evaluates to a boolean.",
        "explanation": "Since the expression `age >= 18` produces the exact `true` or `false` value we need, we can just return its result directly."
      },

        "question": "What will `canPlayerVote(17)` return?",

          "False",
          "17",
          "Error"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "False",
        "explanation": "The condition `17 >= 18` is false, so the function returns `false`."

        "options": [
          "It runs faster.",
          "It uses less memory.",
          "It is more concise and easier to read for experienced developers.",
          "It handles more age ranges."
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "It is more concise and easier to read for experienced developers.",
        "explanation": "While performance differences are negligible, the main advantage is code conciseness and clarity."

        "options": [
          "It is automatically printed.",
          "You can't use it, it just ends the function.",
          "By assigning it to a variable, like `let result = myFunction();`",

        "correctAnswer": "By assigning it to a variable, like `let result = myFunction();`",
        "explanation": "The return value is passed back to the place where the function was called, so you can store it in a variable or use it in another expression."
