  "learningContent": "<h3>Blueprints and Instances: Classes and Objects</h3><p>In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), <strong>classes</strong> and <strong>objects</strong> are two of the most important concepts. They work together to create structured and powerful programs.</p><h4>What is a Class?</h4><p>A <strong>class</strong> is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of properties (attributes) and methods (behaviors) that the objects created from it will have. A class itself is not an object; it's the plan for making objects.</p><p>Think of a cookie cutter. The cookie cutter is the class. It defines the shape and pattern of the cookie, but it isn't a cookie itself.</p><pre><code>// A 'Car' class definition in JavaScript\nclass Car {\n  // The constructor is a special method for creating and initializing an object\n  constructor(brand, color) {\n    this.brand = brand;\n    this.color = color;\n    this.isEngineOn = false;\n  }\n\n  // A method\n  startEngine() {\n    this.isEngineOn = true;\n    console.log('Engine started.');\n  }\n\n  // Another method\n  displayInfo() {\n    console.log(`This is a ${this.color} ${this.brand}.`);\n  }\n}</code></pre><h4>What is an Object?</h4><p>An <strong>object</strong> is an instance of a class. It's the actual 'thing' that is created from the blueprint. Using our cookie analogy, the objects are the cookies you make using the cookie cutter. You can create many objects (cookies) from a single class (cookie cutter), and each one is a unique instance.</p><p>Objects are created from classes using the `new` keyword.</p><pre><code>// Creating two 'Car' objects (instances) from the 'Car' class\nlet myCar = new Car('Toyota', 'blue');\nlet neighborsCar = new Car('Honda', 'red');\n\n// Each object has its own properties and can use the class methods\nmyCar.displayInfo(); // Outputs: This is a blue Toyota.\nneighborsCar.displayInfo(); // Outputs: This is a red Honda.\n\nmyCar.startEngine(); // Outputs: Engine started.\nconsole.log(myCar.isEngineOn); // Outputs: true\nconsole.log(neighborsCar.isEngineOn); // Outputs: false</code></pre><h4>The `constructor` Method</h4><p>The `constructor` is a special method within a class. It's called automatically when you create a new object (an instance) of that class. Its job is to initialize the object's properties. In the example above, the constructor sets the `brand` and `color` for each new car.</p><h4>Summary</h4><p>Classes are the blueprints, and objects are the actual instances created from those blueprints. This relationship allows you to define a structure once (the class) and then create many independent, unique objects that share that same structure.</p>",

        "explanation": "A class defines the properties and methods that its objects will have, but it is not an object itself. It's the plan."

        "question": "What is an 'object' in the context of OOP?",
        "options": [
          "A general concept or idea",
          "A comment in the code",
          "A specific instance of a class",
          "The main file of a program"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "A specific instance of a class",
        "explanation": "An object is a concrete entity created from a class's blueprint, with its own set of property values."

          "object",
          "new"

        "correctAnswer": "new",
        "explanation": "The `new` keyword signals the creation of a new object based on the class that follows it, for example `let myObject = new MyClass();`."

      {
        "question": "What is the purpose of the `constructor` method in a class?",
        "options": [
          "To destroy the object",
          "To initialize an object's properties when it is created",

        ],
        "correctAnswer": "To initialize an object's properties when it is created",
        "explanation": "The constructor runs automatically when a new object is instantiated and is used to set up its initial state and properties."

        "options": [
          "Yes, they are both `Dog` objects",
          "Yes, they point to the same location in memory",
          "No, they are two separate, independent instances of the `Dog` class",
          "It's impossible to tell"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "No, they are two separate, independent instances of the `Dog` class",
        "explanation": "Each time you use the `new` keyword, you create a brand new, unique object in memory, even if it's from the same class."

          "Method",
          "Property",
          "Class"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Class",
        "explanation": "The cookie cutter is the blueprint (Class) that defines the shape. The actual cookies you make are the instances (Objects)."

        "question": "Can you create multiple objects from a single class?",
        "options": [
          "No, one class can only create one object",
          "Yes, you can create as many objects as you need from one class",
          "Only if the class has no methods",
          "Only in specific programming languages"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Yes, you can create as many objects as you need from one class",
        "explanation": "This is a primary benefit of using classes. You define the blueprint once and can then create countless instances from it."

        "question": "Inside a class method, what does the `this` keyword typically refer to?",
        "options": [
          "The class itself",
