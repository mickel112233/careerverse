  "learningContent": "<h3>Understanding Data Types</h3><p>In programming, data comes in various types. A **data type** is a classification that tells the computer how to interpret a value. It determines what kind of operations you can perform on the data. Let's look at the most common and fundamental data types.</p><h4>Numbers</h4><p>Numbers are used for mathematical calculations. Most programming languages have at least two types of numbers:</p><ul><li><strong>Integers:</strong> Whole numbers, without any decimal part (e.g., -5, 0, 10, 250).</li><li><strong>Floating-Point Numbers (Floats):</strong> Numbers that have a decimal part (e.g., -3.14, 0.5, 99.99).</li></ul><p>You can perform all standard arithmetic operations on numbers, like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.</p><h4>Strings</h4><p>A **string** is a sequence of characters used to represent text. You create a string by enclosing text in quotes (either single quotes <code>' '</code> or double quotes <code>\" \"</code>). </p><p><code>let greeting = \"Hello, World!\";</code></p><p>You can do things like join strings together (concatenation) or find the length of a string.</p><h4>Booleans</h4><p>A **boolean** is a data type that can only have one of two values: <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Booleans are the foundation of logic and decision-making in programs. They are used in conditions to determine which path a program should take.</p><p>For example, you might have a variable <code>isGameOver</code>. If it's <code>true</code>, you show the 'Game Over' screen. If it's <code>false</code>, the game continues.</p><h4>Why Do Data Types Matter?</h4><p>Data types are crucial because they prevent errors. For example, it doesn't make sense to divide the string \"apple\" by the number 3. The programming language uses data types to catch these kinds of illogical operations. When you declare a variable, the language often assigns it a data type based on the value you give it. This is called **dynamic typing** (common in Python, JavaScript). In other languages, you must explicitly declare the type, which is called **static typing** (common in Java, C++).</p>",
