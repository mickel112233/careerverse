  "learningContent": "<h3>Organizing Code with Functions</h3><p>As programs grow, you need a way to organize your code into reusable blocks. This is where functions come in. A <strong>function</strong> is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.</p><h4>What is a Function?</h4><p>A function is like a recipe. You define it once, and you can 'call' or 'invoke' it many times to get the same result. This follows the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle of programming.</p><ul><li><strong>Parameters:</strong> Functions can accept inputs, called parameters (or arguments), which can be used inside the function.</li><li><strong>Return Value:</strong> Functions can process data and send a result back to the code that called it using the `return` keyword.</li></ul><pre><code>// Defining a function named 'add'\nfunction add(num1, num2) {\n  // num1 and num2 are parameters\n  let sum = num1 + num2;\n  return sum; // This is the return value\n}\n\n// Calling the function and storing the result\nlet result = add(5, 3); // result is now 8</code></pre><h4>Methods vs. Functions</h4><p>You will often hear the term 'method'. A <strong>method</strong> is simply a function that belongs to an object. It's the same concept, but it's associated with a specific object and often acts on that object's data.</p><pre><code>let person = {\n  name: 'Alex',\n  // greet is a method of the 'person' object\n  greet: function() {\n    return 'Hello, my name is ' + this.name;\n  }\n};\n\nconsole.log(person.greet()); // Outputs: 'Hello, my name is Alex'</code></pre><h4>Why Use Functions?</h4><ul><li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Write once, use everywhere.</li><li><strong>Organization:</strong> Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces.</li><li><strong>Readability:</strong> Well-named functions make code easier to understand.</li><li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> If you need to change how a task is done, you only need to update it in one placeâ€”the function definition.</li></ul>",

      {
        "question": "What is the main benefit of using functions in programming?",
        "options": [
          "To make the code run faster",
          "To write reusable code that can be called multiple times",
          "To make the final program file smaller",
          "To use more variables"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "To write reusable code that can be called multiple times",
        "explanation": "Functions embody the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle, allowing you to define a block of code once and reuse it wherever needed, which improves organization and maintainability."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the term for the input values that a function can accept?",
        "options": [
          "Returns",
          "Variables",
          "Parameters or Arguments",
          "Methods"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "Parameters or Arguments",
        "explanation": "'Parameters' are the names listed in the function definition, and 'arguments' are the real values passed to the function when it is invoked."
      },
      {
        "question": "What does the 'return' keyword do in a function?",
        "options": [
          "It stops the entire program",
          "It prints a value to the console",
          "It sends a value back from the function to the code that called it",
          "It restarts the function"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "It sends a value back from the function to the code that called it",
        "explanation": "The `return` statement ends the function's execution and specifies a value to be returned to the function caller."
      },
      {
        "question": "What is the primary difference between a method and a function?",
        "options": [
          "There is no difference",
          "A method is a function that belongs to an object",
          "A method cannot have parameters",
          "Functions are only used in JavaScript"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "A method is a function that belongs to an object",
        "explanation": "A method is context-specific; it's a function that is a property of an object and can operate on that object's data (often using the `this` keyword)."
      },
      {
        "question": "If you call a function that was defined as `function multiply(a, b) { return a * b; }` with `multiply(4, 5)`, what is the result?",
        "options": [
          "9",
          "1",
          "45",
          "20"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "20",
        "explanation": "The function takes two arguments, 4 and 5, multiplies them, and returns the product, which is 20."
      },
      {
        "question": "The principle of 'Don't Repeat Yourself' is commonly abbreviated as:",
        "options": [
          "WET (Write Everything Twice)",
          "DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)",
          "KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)",
          "YAGNI (You Ain't Gonna Need It)"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)",
        "explanation": "The DRY principle is a core concept in software development that promotes reducing repetition of code, which is a primary benefit of using functions."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens if a function does not have a `return` statement?",
        "options": [
          "It causes a critical error",
          "It returns a default value, often `undefined` or `null`",
          "It returns the value of the last line of code",
          "The program will not compile"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "It returns a default value, often `undefined` or `null`",
        "explanation": "If a function completes without hitting a `return` statement, it implicitly returns a default value. In JavaScript, this value is `undefined`."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you call or invoke a function named `myFunction`?",
        "options": [
          "run myFunction",
          "myFunction()",
          "call myFunction",
          "function myFunction"
        ],
        "correctAnswer": "myFunction()",
        "explanation": "To execute a function, you use its name followed by parentheses `()`. Any arguments would be placed inside the parentheses."
