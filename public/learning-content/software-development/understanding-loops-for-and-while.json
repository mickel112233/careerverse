  "learningContent": "<h3>Automating Repetition: Loops</h3><p>Loops are control flow structures that allow you to run a block of code over and over again. Without loops, tasks like processing every item in a list or counting from 1 to 100 would require you to write the same code repeatedly. There are two main types of loops you'll encounter: the <code>for</code> loop and the <code>while</code> loop.</p><h4>The <code>while</code> Loop</h4><p>A <code>while</code> loop is the simpler of the two. It repeats a block of code **while** a specified condition is true. It checks the condition *before* each iteration.</p><pre><code>let count = 1;\nwhile (count <= 5) {\n  console.log(\"The count is: \" + count);\n  count = count + 1; // Or count++\n}</code></pre><p>This code will print the numbers 1 through 5. It's crucial to have a line of code inside the loop that changes the condition (<code>count = count + 1</code>). If you don't, the condition will always be true, and you'll create an **infinite loop**, which will crash your program!</p><h4>The <code>for</code> Loop</h4><p>A <code>for</code> loop is generally used when you know how many times you want the loop to run. It combines three parts into one line: initialization, condition, and final expression (or increment).</p><pre><code>for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\n  console.log(\"The number is \" + i);\n}</code></pre><p>This will print the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4. Let's break down the parts in the parentheses:</p><ol><li><strong>Initialization (<code>let i = 0</code>):</strong> This runs only once, at the very beginning. It sets up a counter variable.</li><li><strong>Condition (<code>i < 5</code>):</strong> This is checked *before* each iteration. If it's true, the loop continues. If it's false, the loop stops.</li><li><strong>Final Expression (<code>i++</code>):</strong> This runs at the *end* of each iteration. It's typically used to increment the counter. <code>i++</code> is shorthand for <code>i = i + 1</code>.</li></ol><h4>For vs. While</h4><ul><li>Use a <strong><code>for</code> loop</strong> when you know the exact number of iterations (e.g., looping 10 times, or looping through every item in an array).</li><li>Use a <strong><code>while</code> loop</strong> when you want to loop until a certain condition is no longer true, but you don't know how many iterations that will take (e.g., waiting for user input, or running until a character's health is depleted).</li></ul>",

        "correctAnswer": "A loop that never ends because its condition always remains true.",
        "explanation": "An infinite loop occurs when the loop's condition is never updated to become false, causing the program to get stuck and often crash."
