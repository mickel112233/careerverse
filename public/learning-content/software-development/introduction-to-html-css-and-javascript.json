This lesson covers the three fundamental technologies that form the backbone of virtually every website and web application: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p><h4>HTML: The Structure</h4><p>HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's the standard language used to create the structure and content of web pages. Think of it as the skeleton of a house. It defines all the elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more.</p><ul><li><strong>Elements:</strong> Building blocks of HTML, represented by tags (e.g., <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> for a paragraph).</li><li><strong>Tags:</strong> Usually come in pairs, like <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/h1&gt;</code>, to open and close an element.</li><li><strong>Attributes:</strong> Provide additional information about an element, like <code>src</code> in an <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> tag to specify the image source.</li></ul><h4>CSS: The Style</h4><p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to describe the presentation and styling of a document written in HTML. If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the paint, furniture, and decor. It controls colors, fonts, spacing, layout, and even animations.</p><ul><li><strong>Selectors:</strong> Patterns used to select the HTML elements you want to style (e.g., <code>h1</code>, <code>.my-class</code>, <code>#unique-id</code>).</li><li><strong>Properties:</strong> The specific style you want to apply, like <code>color</code>, <code>font-size</code>, or <code>margin</code>.</li><li><strong>Values:</strong> The setting for a property, such as <code>blue</code> for the <code>color</code> property.</li></ul><h4>JavaScript: The Interactivity</h4><p>JavaScript (JS) is a programming language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and much more. It's the 'engine' of the house that makes things happen. When you click a button, see a popup, or watch a page update without reloading, that's JavaScript at work.</p><ul><li><strong>Variables:</strong> Containers for storing data values.</li><li><strong>Functions:</strong> Blocks of code designed to perform a particular task.</li><li><strong>Events:</strong> Actions that can be detected by JavaScript, like a mouse click or a key press, which can then trigger a function.</li></ul><h3>Summary</h3><p>Together, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are the core trio of front-end web development. HTML provides the content and structure, CSS handles the visual presentation, and JavaScript adds the layer of interactivity that makes modern web applications so powerful and engaging.</p>",
