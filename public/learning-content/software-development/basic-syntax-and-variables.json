  "learningContent": "<h3>Syntax and Variables: The Grammar of Code</h3><p>Every programming language has its own set of rules for how to structure statements. This is called **syntax**. Getting the syntax right is crucial. Even a small mistake, like a missing semicolon or parenthesis, can cause the entire program to fail.</p><h4>What is a Variable?</h4><p>A variable is like a container or a labeled box where you can store a piece of information. You give the box a name, and you can put data inside it. You can also change the data inside the box later. Variables are fundamental to programming because they allow us to work with data that can change.</p><h4>Declaring a Variable</h4><p>Creating a variable is called **declaring** it. The syntax for this varies between languages, but the concept is the same. You typically use a keyword (like <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, or <code>const</code> in JavaScript, or just the variable name in Python) to declare a variable and give it a name.</p><p>For example, in a language like JavaScript:</p><p><code>let score;</code></p><p>This creates a variable named 'score'.</p><h4>Assigning a Value</h4><p>Putting data into a variable is called **assignment**. You use the assignment operator, which is usually the equals sign (<code>=</code>).</p><p><code>let score = 100;</code></p><p>This declares a variable named 'score' and assigns it the value of 100.</p><h4>Naming Conventions</h4><p>Choosing good variable names is very important for writing readable code. Here are some common conventions:</p><ul><li><strong>Be Descriptive:</strong> A name like <code>userScore</code> is much better than <code>x</code>.</li><li><strong>camelCase:</strong> In this style, the first word is lowercase, and subsequent words are capitalized (e.g., <code>userScore</code>, <code>playerHealth</code>). This is common in JavaScript.</li><li><strong>snake_case:</strong> In this style, words are separated by underscores (e.g., <code>user_score</code>, <code>player_health</code>). This is common in Python.</li><li><strong>Cannot start with a number:</strong> Variable names must typically start with a letter or an underscore.</li></ul><p>Mastering variables is the first major step in making your programs dynamic and powerful.</p>",
