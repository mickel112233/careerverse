SEO, or Search Engine Optimization, is the practice of increasing the quantity and quality of traffic to your website through organic search engine results. In simpler terms, it's about getting your website to show up at the top of Google, Bing, or any other search engine without paying for ads. Think of it as a competition: every time someone searches for something online, search engines like Google look at billions of websites and decide which ones are the most relevant and trustworthy to show first. Your job as an SEO is to make your website the most relevant and trustworthy answer.</p><p>Why does this matter? Well, over 90% of all internet traffic comes from search engines. People who find your website through a search are often actively looking for what you offer, which means they are more likely to become customers or loyal readers. SEO gives your business or blog visibility, credibility, and a constant flow of traffic. It's a long-term investment, not a quick fix, but the payoff can be immense. Mastering SEO is like learning the secret language of the internet, allowing you to connect with millions of people who are already looking for you.</p>"

The process can be broken down into three key stages: crawling, indexing, and ranking.</p><p>Crawling is the first step. Search engines use automated programs called crawlers (or \"spiders\") to discover new and updated web pages. These crawlers follow links from page to page, reading the code and content of each one. If a new page is linked from an existing, high-quality page, a crawler is more likely to find it quickly. This is why having a strong internal and external linking structure is so important.</p><p>Next is indexing. Once a crawler finds a page, it analyzes the content and stores it in a massive database called an index. This is where Google essentially takes a digital photograph of your website. If a page isn't in Google's index, it can't show up in search results.</p><p>Finally, there's ranking. When you type a query into a search engine, the engine looks at all the indexed pages and uses a complex algorithm to decide which ones are the most relevant and authoritative for that specific query. This is where your SEO efforts come into play. Factors like keywords, link quality, page speed, and user experience all influence where your page lands in the search results.</p>"

They are the bridge between what people are looking for and the content you provide. But it's not enough to just know what people are searching for; you also need to understand their search intent. Search intent is the reason behind the search. Why is the person searching for this keyword?</p><p>There are four main types of search intent:</p> <ul><li>Informational: The user wants to learn something (e.g., \"how to bake a cake\").</li><li>Navigational: The user wants to find a specific website (e.g., \"Facebook login\").</li><li>Transactional: The user wants to buy something (e.g., \"buy running shoes\").</li><li>Commercial Investigation: The user is researching a product before a purchase (e.g., \"best running shoes 2024\").</li></ul><p>You need to align your content with the user's intent. If someone is searching for \"how to bake a cake,\" they don't want to buy baking supplies; they want a recipe. If you write a recipe, you have a better chance of ranking for that keyword.

To improve your page speed, you can optimize your images, minify your code, and use a content delivery network (CDN).
