            content: `<h3>What is Copywriting? The Core Concept</h3><p>Welcome to your new journey into the world of copywriting! At its core, copywriting is the art and science of writing text for the purpose of advertising or other forms of marketing. The goal of copywriting is to persuade a person or a group of people to take a specific action. This action could be to buy a product, sign up for a newsletter, click a link, or even just call a phone number.</p><p>Unlike journalism or creative writing, copywriting is all about salesmanship in print. It’s not about telling a story for entertainment; it’s about writing words that sell. A good copywriter understands psychology, human emotion, and the power of a single word. They know how to craft a message that resonates with a person’s needs, desires, and pain points. Your job as a copywriter is to be a bridge between a product and a customer, using words to make the connection. It's a high-demand skill that can be applied to nearly every business.</p>`

This action is called a call to action (CTA). A CTA could be a button that says "Buy Now," a link that says "Learn More," or a form that asks for an email address.</p><p>Your entire piece of copy should be a logical and compelling path that leads the reader to that single action. Every word, every sentence, and every paragraph should serve this purpose. If a piece of copy is clever but doesn’t make the reader take action, it has failed. The one thing that matters in copywriting is conversion, which is when a reader takes the action you want them to take. Everything you write should be written with this in mind.</p>`
