Your task is to generate a detailed, multi-stage learning roadmap for the subject '{{{streamName}}}'.

The roadmap must be divided into exactly three stages, in this order: "Beginning", "Intermediate", and "Advance".
- The "Beginning" stage should have 30 levels, starting with the most fundamental concepts.
- The "Intermediate" stage should have 50 levels, building upon the basics.
- The "Advance" stage should have 70 levels, covering expert-level topics.

For EACH level within EACH stage, you MUST provide:
1.  A concise, engaging 'title' for the learning module.
2.  A one-sentence 'description' of the key topics covered.
3.  An 'xp' value between 100 and 500, with XP increasing for more advanced levels.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS**:
1. The final output MUST be a valid JSON object.
2. The root object must have a 'roadmap' property which is an array of stage objects.
3. There must be exactly THREE stage objects in the 'roadmap' array.
4. Each stage object must have a 'stageName' ("Beginning", "Intermediate", or "Advance") and a 'levels' array.
5. Every single level object in every 'levels' array MUST be a complete object containing the 'title', 'description', and 'xp' fields.
6. Do not leave any objects incomplete. Double-check your final output to ensure the JSON is not truncated and every entry is complete before finishing your response.

Return the entire roadmap as a single JSON object.
